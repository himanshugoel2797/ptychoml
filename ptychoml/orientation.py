"""Orientation auto-detect for the live ptycho-ViT inference pipeline.

The model can be fed detector frames in any one of 8 D4-rotated orientations,
and only one of them matches the orientation the model was trained against.
``hxn_to_vit.py`` solves this offline by sweeping every plausible
combination and scoring each against a forward-model NCC; this module is
the live-pipeline dual, scoped to the only axis the inference path actually
has to choose at run time.

Search space: ``dp_orient`` ∈ ``D4_NAMES`` (8 candidates).

Scoring: forward-physics consistency. For each candidate ``dp_orient``,
the auto-detector

  1. preprocesses the raw intensity with that ``dp_orient`` and runs
     inference,
  2. forward-models the predicted amplitude + phase through the baked
     probe: ``I_sim = |fft2(probe · (amp · e^{iφ}))|²``,
  3. scores the NCC between ``I_sim`` and the measured intensity in the
     model-input frame.

The winning ``dp_orient`` is the one where the model's predictions
reproduce the measured intensity under the actual physics — every other
candidate produces patches that don't FFT back to the right pattern.

**Why no ``patch_flip`` sweep:** the baked probe lives in the model's
output frame (it's the probe that trained the model), so the model
naturally emits patches aligned with the probe. Applying any
``patch_flip ≠ identity`` before the forward FFT mis-aligns probe and
patches, *breaking* the forward score — so the right value is always
``identity`` for inference correctness. ``patch_flip`` is therefore a
pure dashboard / canvas-display preference, configured manually rather
than auto-detected.

**Why no ``position_signs`` / ``swap_xy`` sweep:** the per-frame forward
model is local — ``|fft2(probe · ψ_i)|²`` only uses the patch and probe,
not the scan position. Position sign and swap conventions only affect
canvas stitching layout, not inference correctness; they're operator-side
configuration knobs that the auto-detector has no leverage to choose
between.

Source: this module is the live-mode dual of ptycho-vit's
``scripts/hxn_to_vit.py`` sweep, restricted to what forward-physics with
a baked probe can resolve.
